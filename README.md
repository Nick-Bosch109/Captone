Paper Football kicker: Nick Bosch & Destin Shedd: 5/13

Design Summery: The paper football kicker is a robot that kicks a paper football based on the distance your hands are away from the machiene. It uses a DC motor and a basic distance sensor 
which then powers the motor based on how much distance it is reading, for example: if the distance sensor is reading a high value the motor will activate at a high percentage of power. The 
device also includes a scoreboard made out of LEDs that is based on user input. 

Parts list:
1- Ultrasonic Distance Sensor (4.50)
2- REV hex shaft motor (28.50)
3- Motor Controller (2.30)
4- Arduino Uno (10.00)
5- Rassberry PI 4 (35.00)
6- LEDs (0.50?)
7- 3D printed custom parts (FREE)
8- Switch (1.00)
9- Paper Football (FREE)
10- Misc REV parts (5.00)
11- Mini breadboards (2.00)
12- 220 & 330 resistors (1.00)
Total Price: $84.8

Evaluation: This protoype has a interactive scoreboard which covers user input and also display, a DC motor and kicker which is the actuator, a distance sensor which covers the automatic sensor,
and lots of code as well as 2 microcontrollers which cover the logic part of the project. I think we should get +10% for the design of the prototype as when it is complete all the wireing and 
will be covered as well as having a couple external parts which serve function as well as a athstetic purpose. 

Lessons Learned: 
1- Plan, Plan, Plan: We did not plan enough for this project and had to switch things up multiple times.
2- Stuff Does not work: Alot of the things we tried didnt work at first and we either needed help or we needed to just keep trying.
3- Use time better: We used our time well but maybe not the best we could have, this has led to quite the rush here at the end to get things done.
4- The Voltage Problem: Before the project starts we really shouldve figured out a solid sorce of power but instead not we have to use 2 different types.
