Design Summary: The paper football kicker is a robot that kicks a paper football based on the distance your hands are away from the machine. It uses a DC motor and a basic distance sensor which then powers the motor based on how much distance it is reading, for example: if the distance sensor is reading a high value the motor will activate at a high percentage of power. The device also includes a scoreboard made out of LEDs that is based on user input.

Parts list: 
1- Ultrasonic Distance Sensor (4.50) 
2- REV hex shaft motor (28.50) 
3- Motor Controller (2.30) 
4- Arduino Uno (10.00) 
5- Raspberry PI 4 (35.00) 
6- LEDs (0.50?) 
7- 3D printed custom parts (FREE) 
8- Switch (1.00) 
9- Paper Football (FREE) 
10- Misc REV parts (5.00) 
11- Mini breadboards (2.00) 
12- 220 & 330 resistors (1.00) 
Total Price: $84.8

Evaluation: This prototype has an interactive scoreboard which covers user input and also displays, a DC motor and kicker which is the actuator, a distance sensor which covers the automatic sensor, and lots of code as well as 2 microcontrollers which cover the logic part of the project. I think we should get +10% for the design of the prototype as when it is complete all the wiring will be covered as well as having a couple external parts which serve function as well as an aesthetic purpose.

Lessons Learned: 1- Plan, Plan, Plan: We did not plan enough for this project and had to switch things up multiple times. 2- Stuff Does not work: A Lot of the things we tried didn't work at first and we either needed help or we needed to just keep trying. 3- Use time better: We used our time well but maybe not the best we could have, this has led to quite the rush here at the end to get things done. 4- The Voltage Problem: Before the project starts we really should have figured out a solid source of power but instead not we have to use 2 different types. 5- We also learned that we need to work together as a team and that if we dont things wont get done.

How to make: 
1- Print all of the parts that we have made in shape, this will take awhile so you can do other stuff while this is happening.
2- Assemble the robot, make sure that all of the gears and chains are correctly placed and work properly.
3- final step is to write the code and make sure that everything is correctly organized between the arduino and the raspberry PI 4.
4- Lastly just assemble everything and make sure that the parts work cohesively together.
